- [x] Replace background subtraction with skin color detection in detect_hand_gesture method
- [x] Lower contour area threshold from 5000 to 2000
- [x] Add debugging prints for contour areas and gesture detection
- [x] Test real_time_gesture_recognition to verify gestures are detected (skipped by user)
